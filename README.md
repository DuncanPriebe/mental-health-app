# Welcome to Team Overwatch

Welcome to the GitHub repo for the CSC Mental Health App Challenge October 5-6, 2016 for team OverWatch.

Overview

We are please to present the preliminary concept of our team’s mobile application in response to the CSC Mental Health App Challenge. Our team adopted the name OverWATCH as the term elicits a sense of safety, comfort and trust... all factors that we feels are critical in reaching out to our front line staff.

Our design places a heavy influence on engaging the user to connect with other users as we felt that this was the ultimate “problem” we we’re trying to solve with our application. You’ll notice the choice of colours that flow in various intensity as the application attempts to mirror the state that the user is in. The primary feature we worked on was the assessment tool, which can be used by users and their families to track where they are currently and where they have come.

The composition of our team was where we build our foundation. We chose to build our team around the ideas that we need to keep the families of affected staff in the forefront of our design. So our team welcomed Michelle Duncan, widow of Correctional Peace Officer Jeff Duncan who died by suicide, who flew out from Alberta to be part of Team OverWATCH.

We also wanted to involve as many people as possible and looked to create a virtual, decentralized team that would welcome and solicit feedback from any interested party. A Facebook Group was created and reached over 100 members, which allowed for real time collaboration between people working remotely. We also connected with David Molina and his non-profit, OperationCode.org, based in Portland, Oregon. OperationCode helps connect Military Veterans with professional mentors in the IT industry. With the support of OperationCode, Team OverWATCH was able to take this app challenge internationally! We then internally and pulled together a local support team that would pull it all together.

App Modules

Activities:
A list of 6 generally accepted activities that can be done to help reduce stress and maintain proper mental readiness. This feature will expand to include integration with wearable fitness devices and track movement, sleep, heart rate, breathing rate, etc... *potential data for PTSD research on effective techniques

View Leave:
API Pull request from HRMS leave system. No database writing required as the application will simply be pulling the data out and presenting it to the client. No database manipulation is available, think of it as READ ONLY.

View Pay:
API Pull request from Phoenix Payroll system. No database writing required as the application will simply be pulling the data out and presenting it to the client. No database manipulation is available, think of it as READ ONLY.

Peer Support:
This would become the platform.

Assessment:
Using the concept from R2MR, this feature is an interactive assessment guide to get a snap shot of a client’s mental readiness. This feature will track the assessments and allow for review between the client and mental health professionals during appointments. The application will also compile all the answers from the assessment and provide and overall rating.

Medeo:
This is a tele-med feature that currently exists in BC. It allows for video conferring technology to facilitate video meetings between patients and family doctors and psychologist.

Settings:
Application settings are contained here, which includes GPS, display, reminders, and more.

Forum:
A place where people can ask anonymous questions relating to mental health, and the “community” can provide the feedback. If you are familiar with reddit.com, it would follow a similar idea. “Contributors” must be logged in, so we have a mechanism in place to keep the feedback relevant. In time, the community will get to up vote or down vote certain answers. So we build a database of best practices that worked for people, and that are peer reviewed.

About:

Help Me:
This is an emergency feature that when pressed, will pop up a confirmation that the user will be connected to a professional peer support crisis line. Also, it should be noted that during the Assessment portion of the assessment, if a user comes out from the assessment as being in the red, the Help Me feature will become prevalent throughout ALL pages of the app, thus encourage the user to reach out.
